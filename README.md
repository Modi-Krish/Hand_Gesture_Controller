# Hand_Gesture_Controller
Designed a touchless interaction feature using OpenCV and contour detection to recognize specific hand gestures. Enabled users to trigger predefined actions (e.g., switching views, starting/stopping attendance) by simply showing hand signs to the camera, enhancing safety and interactivity.
